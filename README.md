This is the front-end for [our submission to the 2020 HackZÃ¼rich Hackathon](http://devpost.com/software/digimatic), [the backend is avaliable here](https://github.com/BryanSky/image-processing-backend).

We were inspired by PhotoMath and what it represented for mathematics, and we thought it might be useful to have such a tool for schematics. Moving the Schematics from paper form to digital means that you have the freedom to use it and store it anywhere. Easier integration with BMS (building management systems) Maintenances and assets management software. Easier facilities management and control

The user interface was based around WolframAlpha's, because we're striving to be a PhotoMath for schematics.
